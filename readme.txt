A plugin for creating generic widgets with content/settings.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to do the following:
* Keep your HTML and display logic in templates
* Keep your widget content and settings in the CMS
* Allow you to make new widgets without having to make or install new plugins

The templates for each widget are named in a specific manner (wordlets-{name}.php or wordlets/{name}.php).

Within each template you print content like so: <?php echo wordlet('some_name') ?>.

After creating a template and filling it with html and references to content, you can add a widget which references that template in the admin interface.

The Widget will automatically know when templates have been added and it will build the admin interface based on the wordlet($name) tags in the templates.

You can add additional information to the wordlet() call to make the admin interface a little nicer. The full parameters are

    wordlet({name} [, {default value} [, {label text} [, {extra description under input} ]]] )

The input type will be inferred from the "default value":
* Boolean values (true/false), will be checkboxes
* Anything with a return ("\n") will be a textarea
* Arrays will be a select box
* Integers will be a number box
* Everything else is a text box

Example:

Assume you have a file called wordlets-test.php and in it you have these contents:

    <?php

    /**
    * Name: Test
    * Description: Test Wordlet Template
    */

    ?>

    <div class="test <?=wordlet('style', array('small', 'medium', 'big'), 'Style', 'Adjusts the look of the form') ?>">
        <h2 class="headline"><?=wordlet('title', 'Sign up for things', 'Title', 'Above the form') ?></h2>

        <? if ( ($text = wordlet('greeting', "Thank you for taking the time to fill this form out\n", 'Greeting')) ): ?>
            <p><?=$text ?></p>
        <? endif ?>

        <form action="http://example.com/some-remote-site">
            <? foreach ( wordlet_array('tracking-vars', '', 'Tracking Variables', 'Key = name, Value = value, as in name="utm-source" value="blog"') as $input ): ?>
                <input type="hidden" name="<?=$input->key ?>" value="<?=$input->value ?>">
            <? endforeach ?>

            <p class="input text">
                <label for="test-name"><?=wordlet('required-label', '*', 'Required Label') ?> <?=wordlet('name-label', 'Input your name', 'Name Label') ?></label>
                <input type="text" name="name" id="test-name">
            </p>
            <p class="input text email">
                <label for="test-email"><?=wordlet('required-label') ?> <?=wordlet('email-label', 'Input your email', 'Email Label') ?></label>
                <input type="email" name="email" id="test-email">
            </p>
            <? if ( wordlet('show_hear', true, 'Show "Hear about us" dropdown') && ($options = wordlet_array('hear-options', 'Option', '"Hear about us" options')) ): ?>
                <p class="input select">
                    <label for="test-hear"><?=wordlet('hear-label', 'How did you hear about us?', 'Hear about us Label') ?></label>
                    <select name="email" id="test-hear">
                        <? foreach ( $options as $option ): ?>
                            <option><?=$option ?></option>
                        <? endforeach ?>
                    </select>
                </p>
            <? endif ?>
            <p class="input submit">
                <input type="submit" value="<?=wordlet('submit-label', 'Sign me up!', 'Submit Label') ?>">
            </p>
        </form>
    </div>

After saving the file you will now have an option in the Wordlet Widget to use "Test (Test Wordlet Template)".

Once selected you will be presented with a form with various labels/input fields.
